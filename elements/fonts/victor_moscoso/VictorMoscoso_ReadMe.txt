The Victor Moscoso font is based on the 1960s psychedelic poster lettering of the artist Victor Moscoso who was born in Spain, studied at the Cooper Union in New York and under Josef Albers at Yale University, before moving to San Francisco in 1959.The letterforms, originating from nineteenth century wood type, are derived from some of Moscoso's most celebrated Neon Rose posters of the late sixties, in particular the quintessential Moby Grape 'Neptune's Notion' poster of 1967.
